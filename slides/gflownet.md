## Goal

Generate _diverse_ and _high-reward_ samples $x$ from a large search space, given a reward $R(x)$ and a deterministic episodic environment where episodes terminate by generating a sample $x$.

--

Instead of sampling iteratively, as in Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC methods), *Flow Networks* sample _sequentially_, like in episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL), by modelling $\pi(x) \propto R(x)$, that is a distribution proportional to the reward. Unlike RL methods, which generate a single highest-reward sequence, GFlowNet aims to sample multiple, diverse sample.

## Flow Networks

Directed acyclic graph (DAG) with *sources* and *sinks*.

* A single *source* node with _in-flow_ $Z$: $s_0$ 
* *Sink* nodes are assigned a reward $R(x)$: $s_{6,7,8,11,12}$
* The _in-flow_ of the source node equals the sum of sink node's _out-flow_: $\sum_x R(x) = Z$

## Flow Networks
### A generative model

Given the structure of the graph and the reward of the sinks, we wish to calculate a_valid flow_ between nodes.

Multiple solutions are possible in general, which yields a _generative model_

---

## Flow Networks
### A Markov decision process (MDP)

* States: each *node* in the graph
* Actions: each *edge* in the graph

Let
* $Q(s, a) = f(s, s')$ be the flow between nodes $s$ and $s'$
* $T(s, a) = s'$ be the _deterministic_ state transition to from state $s$ and action $a$.
* $\pi(a|s) = \frac{Q(s,a)}{\sum_{a'} Q(s,a')}$

Following policy $\pi$ from $s_0$ leads to terminal state $x$ with probability $R(x)$.

## Approximating Flow Networks
### Flow equations

For every node $s'$:

* In-flow: $V(s') = \sum_{s,a:T(s,a)=s'} Q(s,a)$
* Out-flow: $V(s') = \sum_{a' \in \mathcal{A}(s')} Q(s',a')$

--

The in-flow equals the out-flow, and the out-flow of the sink nodes is their associated reward $R(x) > 0$. Thus:

$$
\sum^{s,a:T(s,a)=s'} Q(s,a) = R(s')+ \sum^{a' \in \mathcal{A}(s')} Q(s', a')
$$

--

A flow that satisfies the flow equations produces $\pi(x) = \frac{R(x)}{Z}$

---

## Objective function for RL

$$
\sum^{s,a:T(s,a)=s'} Q(s,a) = R(s')+ \sum^{a' \in \mathcal{A}(s')} Q(s', a')
$$

The above equation can be seen as a recursive value function. We can approximate the flows such that the conditions are satisfied at convergence (as the Bellman conditions for temporal difference learning):

$$
\tilde{\mathcal{L}}_{\theta}(\tau) = \sum^{s' \in \tau \neq s_0} \left( \sum^{s,a:T(s,a)=s'} Q(s,a;\theta) - R(s') - \sum^{a' \in \mathcal{A}(s')} Q(s',a';\theta)\right)^2
$$

--

For better numerical stability:

$$
\footnotesize \tilde{\mathcal{L}}_{\theta,\epsilon}(\tau) = \sum^{s' \in \tau \neq s_0} \left( \log \left[ \epsilon + \sum^{s,a:T(s,a)=s'} \exp Q^{log}(s,a;\theta) \right] - \log \left[ \epsilon + R(s') - \sum^{a' \in \mathcal{A}(s')} \exp Q^{log}(s',a';\theta) \right] \right)^2
$$

## Generating molecules
### Example from the article

Goal: generate a diverse set of small molecules that have high reward. 

* Reward: a proxy model that predicts the binding energy of a molecule to a protein target
* States: every possible molecule, made of blocks (SMILES): up to $10^{16}$ states
* Actions: _what_ block to attach to the molecule of a state, and _where_, plus a _stop action_: 100-2000 actions
