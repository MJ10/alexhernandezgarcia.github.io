## Accelerating material discovery with machine learning
### Motivation

* Renewable energy can be used to transform water into hydrogen or methane and back to electricity
* However, current electrocatalysts are not sufficiently energy-efficient (35 % for round-trip AC to AC)

## Why machine learning?
### Traditional electrocatalyst design

.context[Current electrocatalyst are only up to 35 % energy efficient]

.left-column-33[
* Density Functional Theory is used to estimate the energy of a catalyst-molecule structure
* DFT scales with $O(n^3)$ with the number of electrons
* The calculations for one structure take hours or days
* There are combinatorially many possible candidate materials

## Why machine learning?
### ML world model

.context[Physical models are computationally too expensive for fast discovery.]

.left-column-33[
* Data from physical models can be used to train ML-based approximators
* ML models can be used to more rapidly evaluate candidate materials

Can we do better?

## Why machine learning?
### RL-based exploratory policy 

.context[Using ML to only score candidate materials provides only _linear_ gains.]

.left-column-33[
* We can train ML models to more efficiently search the space of candidate materials
* An RL agent could exploit the structure of the search space

### Summary

.right-column[.center[![:scale 90%](../assets/images/slides/materials/activelearning_agent.png)]]

.left-column[
* World model: graph neural networks (GNN), capable of incorporating invariances and equivariances that preserve physical properties
* Exploratory agent: RL-based algorithms capable of learning the structure of the _world_ to propose diverse, high-reward candidates
