## Collaborators and publications
* Flow Network based Generative Models for Non-Iterative Diverse Candidate Generation
* GFlowNet Foundations
* Biological Sequence Design with GFlowNets
---

## Motivation
.context[Max is not all you need!]
* Scoring functions during search can be unreliable for in silico-search.
    * Capture only a single attribute.
    * Large errors due to approximations and assumptions
*
