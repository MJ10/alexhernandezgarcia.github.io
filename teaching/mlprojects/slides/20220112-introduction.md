## English or French?

This class is offered to both graduate (IFT 6759) and undergraduate students (IFT 3710). Graduate students make a large international crowd, which is why this class is taught in English.

However:

* Feel free to ask questions in French, if you prefer.
* Feel free to ask for a translation, if you don't understand something.
* Let me know (by email) if you prefer to do your assignments in French.

Note: French is not my mother tongue and I am not proficient in French, but my French should be good enough for most things. Otherwise, I am sure other folks in the cclass will be willing to help!

- Spanish, German

## The class in a nutshell

.highlight1[Goal]: to prepare you to tackle real-world machine learning projects

.highlight1[Structure]:

* 4 weeks of introductory and review lectures: `git`, Linux, Python, machine learning, deep learning...
* 10 weeks of project work in teams, with office hours.

.highlight1[At the end of the course], we expect you to be able to:

* Code and train machine learning and deep learning models.
* Analyse the experimental results and draw conclusions.
* Communicate written and orally the main aspects of the project.

## Project guidelines
### What is a project?

For 10 weeks (week 5 to week 14), you will work on a project in teams. The projects of the course are aimed to resemble as much as possible what real-world machine learning projects look like in either industry or research.

--

Projects comprise the following stages:

1. Literature review
2. Planning
3. Development
4. Analysis of results
5. Written report
6. Oral presentation
