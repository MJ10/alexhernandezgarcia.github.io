- Introduction

## English or French?

This class is offered to both graduate (IFT 6759) and undergraduate students (IFT 3710). Graduate students make a large international crowd, which is why this class is taught in English.

However:

* Feel free to ask questions in French, if you prefer.
* Feel free to ask for a translation, if you don't understand something.
* Let me know (by email) if you prefer to do your assignments in French.

Note: French is not my mother tongue and I am not proficient in French, but my French should be good enough for most things. Otherwise, I am sure other folks in the cclass will be willing to help!
